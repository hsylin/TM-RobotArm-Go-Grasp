# TM_go_grasp

Implementation of a solution to control a TM robotic arm using grasp poses generated by PointNetGPD. 


This project enables the robotic arm to receive grasp poses, move to specific locations with specified orientations, and place a Rubik's cube in designated positions for further operations.
